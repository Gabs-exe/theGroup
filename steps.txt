Step 1: Define Requirements and Features
	•	Identify Core Features:
		o	Customer registration and login
		o	Flight search and booking
		o	Manage flight reservations
		o	Seat selection
		o	Purchase in-flight services (food, drinks, etc.)
		o	View booking history and details
		o	Admin features (if required): Add flights, manage bookings, etc.
		
Step 2: Choose Your Technology Stack
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web app)
	•	Backend:
		o	Option 1: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), Java (Spring Boot)
		o	Option 2: C++ for file handling
	•	Data Storage:
		o	Files (since a database is not mandatory)
		o	Consider using JSON, CSV, or plain text files.

Step 3: Design the Flow and UI
	•	Create Wireframes:
		o	Sketch or use tools like Figma to create a basic design of each 			page (e.g., home page, login, booking page, etc.).
	•	Define User Flow:
		o	Example flow: User registers → Logs in → Searches for flights → Selects flight and seats → Makes payment → Receives booking confirmation.

Step 4: Set Up the Project
	•	Create a New Project:
		o	Set up your project directory structure (e.g., separate folders for frontend, backend, and data files).
		o	Initialize version control (e.g., Git).

Step 5: Develop the Frontend
	•	Create Basic Pages:
		o	HTML for structure
		o	CSS for styling
		o	JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., form validation, dynamic content loading)
	•	Pages to Create:
		o	Home
		o	Login/Register
		o	Search Flights
		o	Booking Confirmation
		o	Seat Selection
		o	Purchase In-Flight Services

Step 6: Develop the Backend
	•	Set Up the Server:
		o	Choose a framework (e.g., Express for Node.js, Flask for Python).
		o	Implement basic routing (e.g., handle requests for booking, viewing reservations).
	•	Implement Core Functionalities:
		o	Customer Management: Handle registration, login, and profile management.
		o	Flight Management: Search, book, and manage reservations.
		o	Data Handling: Read/write data to files for flight details, bookings, and user data.

Step 7: Integrate Frontend and Backend
	•	Connect Frontend to Backend:
		o	Use AJAX/fetch API for sending data from the frontend to the backend.
		o	Ensure the frontend can retrieve data (e.g., available flights, booking details) from the backend.

Step 8: Implement Additional Features
	•	In-Flight Services:
		o	Create an interface for users to select and purchase services.
		o	Store the selection in files and update the booking details.
	•	Seat Selection:
		o	Implement seat maps and selection functionality.
		o	Update the booking data with the selected seat.

Step 9: Testing and Debugging
	•	Test Each Component:
		o	Test user flows (e.g., registration, booking) and fix any issues.
		o	Validate data handling (e.g., ensure data is correctly read from and written to files).
	•	Cross-Browser Testing: Ensure compatibility across different web browsers (if applicable).

Step 10: Finalize and Submit
	•	Code Cleanup:
		o	Remove unused code, add comments, and ensure readability.
	•	Documentation:
		o	Prepare a README file explaining how to set up and run the project.
	•	Submission:
		o	Package your project and submit it according to the assignment guidelines.
